    <h2>Week 2 Assignment</h2>
    <p>Build a new HTML page with a list of links to your favorite websites. We will use them as inspiration moving forward, so anything you like, or frankly hate is acceptable! Then commit and push your changes, and share the link to your published code, and your code repo.</p>
